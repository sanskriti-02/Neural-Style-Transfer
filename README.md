# Neural Style Transfer

Neural Style Transfer (NST) has emerged as a powerful tool for merging artistic styles onto diverse content, driven by convolutional neural networks. This paper proposes an innovative approach to NST by integrating two style images, aiming to broaden its application and creative possibilities. Leveraging the VGG-19 model, we adapt the preprocessing pipeline to accommodate dual styles seamlessly.

Our study investigates the impact of input order variations and novel preprocessing techniques, notably incorporating linear interpolation within vector spaces. Addressing challenges such as unweighted style distribution, we explore modifications to convolutional layers inspired by computational environments and data structure theory.

Through interdisciplinary exploration, this research aims to advance the practical application of NST, offering artists and industries enhanced capabilities for creative expression and content generation. By aligning theoretical concepts with practical implementation, we seek to enrich the intersection of art and technology in the realm of image processing.
